Praticas do Jetbrains Academy: Projeto Learning Progress Tracker


### About
Online learning is gaining popularity. A good education platform can manage registrations, track learning progress, send notifications and newsletters to many users worldwide. It is a huge volume of work indeed. In this project, you will build an application that keeps track of the registered users, their learning progress, and metrics. It will also provide detailed information about each user or any category of users and the overall statistics for the entire learning platform.

### Learning outcomes
Practice loops and flow controls, functional decomposition, and SOLID principles. Learn how to process strings and leverage the JUnit testing framework to make sure that your code is error-free. Use suitable collections such as lists and maps to sort and filter data.
